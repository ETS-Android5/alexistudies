    <title>What is a 'normal' resting heart rate?</title>

</head>
<body style="margin:32px">

<p>
    A normal range for an adult resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. However, being outside of this range does not mean you are not heathy. You have your own normal range that is not ‘one size fits all’. This app can help you find your personalized range with repeated measurements over time.

    This app and all of these phone-based heart measurements are for research purposes only. We are still learning the best way to understand and interpret these measurements. You should not base any medical decisions on these measurements. Thank you for helping us to do this research!
