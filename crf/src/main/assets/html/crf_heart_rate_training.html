        <h2>What is this app?</h2>
        <p>
            Like a doctor’s stethoscope, this app can measure your heart rate. Instead of listening to heart beats, this app can “see” your heart rate. It uses the flash and camera right up against your finger to measure. Together with exercise, this app can measure heart rate recovery. This is similar to a measuring your VO2max. This app was developed as a part of the All of Us Research Program. Your measurements will be used for health research.
        </p>

        <h2>What am I being asked to do?</h2>

        <p>
            You are being asked to take “snapshots” of your heart health. A snapshot has two parts. One part is measuring your heart at rest. The other part is measuring how your heart recovers after exercise. Everything in this research study is optional. You can stop at any time.
        </p>

        <h2>How long does a snapshot take?</h2>

        <p>
            Measuring a resting heart rate takes about 1 minute. Measuring heart rate recovery has two options. One option takes 3 minutes and has you go up and down a stair step. The other option takes 12 minutes and has you run or walk.
        </p>

        <h2>Why should I use Heart Snapshot?</h2>

        <p>
            Using this app will help our research about heart health. Most heart measurements in research are from a clinic or a lab. Measurements with this app are from whenever you choose, wherever you are. That makes this information unique. Your measurements may also help you understand your own heart health.
        </p>

        <h2>Is this a diagnostic test?</h2>

        <p>
            No, these measurements are still experimental. This study is helping us to learn how to use these measurements. Heart rate measurements in a clinic or with a doctor are the gold standard.
        </p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>

        <p>
            To measure your heart rate, the app uses the flash to shine light through your finger. The camera records your heart beats and calculates a heart rate. To measure your heart rate recovery score, you first need to raise your heart rate. After steps or a run, we measure how your heart recovers. If you choose to run, we can also use GPS to measure how far you have run. We tested the app before this and found that your heart rate recovery score is similar to your VO2max.
        </p>

        <h2>Who is doing this?</h2>

        <p>
            This app is a part of the All of Us Research Program. It was made by researchers at the non-profit organization Sage Bionetworks and the Scripps Translational Science Institute.
        </p>

        <h2>What will you know about me?</h2>

        <p>
            Using your camera, we will look at the color to "see" your blood flow and thus measure your heart rate. We do NOT save any images from the camera. We will ask about your age and gender. This information helps us to calculate your heart rate recovery score. We will ask about activating your GPS during your run, but this is only to look at how far you have gone. We do NOT know or save data about where you are with the GPS. If you are using this app as a part of the All of Us Research Program, your data will be connected with the rest of the data you’ve shared already.
